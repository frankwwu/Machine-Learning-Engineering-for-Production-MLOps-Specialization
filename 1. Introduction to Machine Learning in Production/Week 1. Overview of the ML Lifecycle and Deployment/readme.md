# Week 1: Overview of the ML Lifecycle and Deployment

This week covers a quick introduction to machine learning production systems focusing on their requirements and challenges. Next, the week focuses on deploying production systems and what is needed to do so robustly while facing constantly changing data.

## Learning Objectives

* Identify the key components of the ML Lifecycle.
* Define “concept drift” as it relates to ML projects.
* Differentiate between shadow, canary, and blue-green deployment scenarios in the context of varying degrees of automation.
* Compare and contrast the ML modeling iterative cycle with the cycle for deployment of ML products.
* List the typical metrics you might track to monitor concept drift.

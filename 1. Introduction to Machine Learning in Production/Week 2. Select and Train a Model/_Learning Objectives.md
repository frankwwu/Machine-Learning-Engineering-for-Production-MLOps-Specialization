## Learning Objectives

* dentify the key challenges in model development.
* Describe how performance on a small set of disproportionately important examples may be more crucial than performance on the * majority of examples.
* Explain how rare classes in your training data can affect performance.
* Define three ways of establishing a baseline for your performance.
* Define structured vs. unstructured data.
* Identify when to consider deployment constraints when choosing a model.
* List the steps involved in getting started with ML modeling.
* Describe the iterative process for error analysis.
* Identify the key factors in deciding what to prioritize when working to improve model accuracy.
* Describe methods you might use for data augmentation given audio data vs. image data.
* Explain the problems you can have training on a highly skewed dataset.
* Identify a use case in which adding more data to your training dataset could actually hurt performance.
* Describe the key components of experiment tracking.

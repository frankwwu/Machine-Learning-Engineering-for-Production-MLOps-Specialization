# Week 3: Data Definition and Baseline

This week is all about working with different data types and ensuring label consistency for classification problems. This leads to establishing a performance baseline for your model and discussing strategies to improve it given your time and resources constraints.

## Learning Objectives

* List the questions you need to answer in the process of data definition.
* Compare and contrast the types of data problems you need to solve for structured vs. unstructured and big vs. small data.
* Explain why label consistency is important and how you can improve it
* Explain why beating human level performance is not always indicative of success of an ML model.
* Make a case for improving human level performance rather than beating it.
* Identify how much training data you should gather given time and resource constraints.
* Describe the key steps in a data pipeline.
* Compare and contrast the proof of concept vs. production phases on an ML project.
* Explain the importance of keeping track of data provenance and lineage.

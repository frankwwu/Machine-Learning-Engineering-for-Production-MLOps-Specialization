# Week 1: Collecting, Labeling and Validating Data

This week covers a quick introduction to machine learning production systems. More concretely you will learn about leveraging the TensorFlow Extended (TFX) library to collect, label and validate data to make it production ready.

## Learning Objectives

* Describe the differences between ML modeling and a production ML system
* Identify responsible data collection for building a fair production ML system
* Discuss data and concept change and how to address it by annotating new training data with direct labeling and/or human labeling
* Address training data issues by generating dataset statistics and creating, comparing and updating data schemas

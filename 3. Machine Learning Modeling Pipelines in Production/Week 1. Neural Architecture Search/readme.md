# Learning Objectives

* Recognize the cases where Neural Architecture Search is the appropriate tool to find the right model architecture.
* Distinguish between trainable parameters and hyperparameters
* Judge when manual parameter search does not scale well
* Identify search spaces and summarize the best strategies to navigate this space to find optimal architectures.
* Differentiate the advantages and disadvantages AutoML for different use cases
* Carry out different metric calculations to assess AutoML efficacy
* Identify some cloud AutoML offerings and recognize their strengths and weaknesses

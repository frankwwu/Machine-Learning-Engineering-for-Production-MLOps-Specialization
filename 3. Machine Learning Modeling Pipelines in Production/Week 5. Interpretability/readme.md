# Learning Objectives

* Deconstruct a model to understand and explain how it is making predictions
* Determine tools to make your models explainable to yourself and others in easy to understand terms
* Provide mechanisms to address model fairness and compliance with regulatory requirements
* Differentiate and compare different methods to extract interpretation of models by introspection or explanation
* Distinguish between multiple available techniques such as: Partial Dependance Plots, SHAP and LIME; to provide insight into how model predictions are actually made
* Use cloud managed service for AI explanations

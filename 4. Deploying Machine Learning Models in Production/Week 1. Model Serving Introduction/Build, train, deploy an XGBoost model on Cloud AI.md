# Optional: Build, train, and deploy an XGBoost model on Cloud AI Platform

This is an optional exercise and will mirror what was shown in the previous screencast. It requires a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account and we placed instructions in the document in case you don't have one yet. If you can't set up an account at the moment, don't worry because you will still use the same tools in some of the course assignments. You'll be given free use of GCP in those labs. This is mainly here for reference to introduce model serving in the cloud.

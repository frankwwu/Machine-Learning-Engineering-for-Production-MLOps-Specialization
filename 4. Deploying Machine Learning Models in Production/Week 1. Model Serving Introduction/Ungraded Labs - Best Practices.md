# Ungraded Labs - Best Practices

As you progress through this course you will see that the majority of ungraded labs are hosted in our public repo and are meant to be run in your local machine using a terminal. 

Some of them do not require you to have a cloned version of the repo but some do. For this reason, we encourage you to clone the repo right away. For the labs that rely on files within the repo, the best way to follow along is to read its documentation from your browser while working on the cloned version of the repo on your local machine.

To clone the repo, use the following command:

git clone [](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-public.git)

or for cloning via SSH use:

git clone [](git@github.com:https-deeplearning-ai/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-public.git)


If you are unsure which method to use, go for the first one.

Also, there might be some updates to the course content occasionally so it's best to do a git pull in your local clone once in a while (especially when starting a new exercise). This will ensure that you have the latest version of the files.


Have fun in the ungraded labs!

# (Optional) Ungraded Lab: Intro to Kubernetes

In this optional lab, you will get more hands-on practice with Kubernetes in preparation for this week's graded assignment. If you haven't already, please clone the public repo. You can do so with the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-public
```

If you've already cloned this before, please do a `git pull` to make sure that you have the latest version of the files.

After that, please navigate to `course4/week2-ungraded-labs/C4_W2_Lab_2_Intro_to_Kubernetes/` then read the root `README.md` with your favorite Markdown reader. Alternatively, you can just clone the repo then just go [here](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-public/tree/main/course4/week2-ungraded-labs/C4_W2_Lab_2_Intro_to_Kubernetes) to use Github's built-in Markdown viewer. Either way, that README file will contain the instructions on how to run the lab in your machine. 

In case you run into any issues, remember to post it in Discourse so mentors and course staff can assist.

# Data preprocessing

Apache Beam is a product that gives you a unified programming model that lets you implement batch and streaming data processing jobs on any execution engine. Itâ€™s ideally suited for data preprocessing!

Go to [](https://beam.apache.org/get-started/try-apache-beam/) to try Apache Beam in a Colab so you can get a handle on how the APIs work. Make sure you try it in Python as well as Java by using the tabs at the top. 

*Note*: You can click the `Run in Colab` button below the code snippet to launch Colab. In the Colab menu bar, click `Runtime > Change Runtime type` then select `Python 3` before running the code cells. You can get more explanations on the WordCount example [here](https://beam.apache.org/get-started/wordcount-example) and you can use the [Beam Programming Guide](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/) as well to look up any of the concepts.

You can learn about TensorFlow Transform here: https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/transform/get_started . It also uses Beam style pipelines but has modules optimized for preprocessing Tensorflow datasets.

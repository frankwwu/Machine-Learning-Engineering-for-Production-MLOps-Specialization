# Learn about scaling with boy bands

In the next few minutes you’ll learn about horizontal and vertical scaling. Before going into that, here’s a fun case study on managing scale. 

In this extreme case a famous boy band called ‘One Direction’ hosted a 10-hour live stream on YouTube, where they instructed fans to go visit a web site with a quiz on it every 10 minutes. This led to a really interesting pattern in scalability where the application would have zero usage for the vast majority of the time, but then, every 10 minutes may have hundreds of thousands of people hitting it. 

It’s a complex problem to solve when it comes to scaling. It could be very expensive to operate. Using smart scaling strategies, Sony Music and Google solved this problem very inexpensively. Laurence isn’t allowed to share how much it cost for the cloud services, but, when he and several of the other engineers went out for celebration drinks after the success of the project, the bar bill was more expensive than the cloud bill. (And they didn’t drink a lot!)

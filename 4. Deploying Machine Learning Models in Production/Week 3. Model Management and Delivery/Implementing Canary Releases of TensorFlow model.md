# Implementing Canary Releases of TensorFlow model deployments with Kubernetes and Istio

In this assignment, you will use Istio on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and TensorFlow Serving to create canary deployments of TensorFlow machine learning models. More concretely, you will:

1. Prepare a GKE cluster with the Istio add-on for TensorFlow Serving.

2. Create a canary release of a TensorFlow model deployment.

3. Configure various traffic splitting strategies.
